Comeonin version 5 has just been released.

This release includes changes that will:

* help support other password hashing libraries
  * Argon2, Bcrypt and Pbkdf2 are already supported
* make it easier for authentication libraries to set password hashing requirements

## Upgrade guide

Remove comeonin from the deps function in your mix.exs file and update
the password hashing library you are using to the newest version - 2.0
for argon2_elixir and bcrypt_elixir, and 1.0 for pbkdf2_elixir.

Then edit the hashing functions as shown in
[this guide](https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/blob/master/UPGRADE_v5.md).

## Comeonin and Comeonin.PasswordHash behaviours

Comeonin now provides two behaviours, Comeonin and Comeonin.PasswordHash,
which password hashing libraries then need to implement.

For developers, this should make the password hashing libraries easier
to use. Once they have learned how to use a library that implements
the Comeonin behaviours, they will easily be able to move to any other
library that implements them.

For authentication library maintainers, instead of depending on a specific
library, an authentication library can accept any password hashing library
that implements the Comeonin behaviours (this is what the
[Phauxth library](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth) now does.

## Argon2

Changes in version 2.0 of argon2_elixir:

* it implements the Comeonin and Comeonin.PasswordHash behaviours
* the default configuration values have been updated
  * in line with the latest
  [Argon2 IETF draft guidelines](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-04)

### Use the Argon2.Stats module

In many cases, the default configuration values will be incorrect, or
inappropriate for the hardware you are using or your situation.
Therefore, it is important to follow the guide in the `Argon2.Stats`
module, using the `report` function, to set the correct configuration
values for your app.

### Low memory servers

The default memory allocation value is now 128 MiB (from 64 MiB in verion 1).

If you are running a server with a low amount of memory, you will probably need
to reduce the m_cost, to 16 (64 MiB) or 15 (32 MiB), or allocate more memory
to the server.
